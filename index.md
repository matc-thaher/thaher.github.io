I am currently a PhD student at the [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/) in Troy, New York, USA, holding a graduate research assistantship with [Dr. Victor Robles Sanchez](https://sites.google.com/yale.edu/vrobles/home). Before this, I completed my Master in Physics in 2022 at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, supervised by [Dr. Soumya D Mohanty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C2xWWFsAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis was entitled "Glitch Estimation and Removal Using Adaptive Spline Fitting and Wavelet Shrinkage on the Gravitational Wave Data" and is available from the [ProQuest eTheses Repository](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2801919094?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).
