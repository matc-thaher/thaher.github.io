# Research

My primary research area involves investigating the properties and interactions of dark matter. Here are some ongoing projects:

## Dark Matter Properties

Exploring dark matter characteristics at both small and large scales to understand its interaction with visible matter and potential effects on cosmological structures.

## Gravitational Wave Data Analysis

This project aims to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave signal detection by reducing noise and interference, especially from glitches.

## Perovskite Conductivity Studies

Studying the effects of doping and polaron behavior in perovskite materials to improve understanding of their electrical conductivity properties.

More details on specific projects can be found in my [Code Projects](/code/) section.
