# Scientific Code and Projects

On this page, youâ€™ll find links to my code repositories and scientific projects, including tools developed for my research in dark matter and data analysis. Many of these projects are open-source and available on GitHub for public use and collaboration.

## Projects

### 1. Dark Matter Simulations
- **Repository**: [Dark Matter Simulation Repository](https://github.com/your-username/dark-matter-simulations)
- **Description**: This project includes a set of scripts and algorithms developed to simulate the behavior of dark matter particles under different conditions. The simulations are designed to help study dark matter properties at various scales and provide insights into its potential interactions.

### 2. Gravitational Wave Data Analysis
- **Repository**: [Wavelet Shrinkage Gravitational Wave Analysis](https://github.com/your-username/gravitational-wave-analysis)
- **Description**: Developed during my Master's thesis, this repository contains code for analyzing gravitational wave data using adaptive spline fitting and wavelet shrinkage. The project aims to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave signal extraction by reducing glitch interference.

### 3. Perovskite Material Conductivity
- **Repository**: [Perovskite Conductivity Analysis](https://github.com/your-username/perovskite-conductivity)
- **Description**: This code is part of ongoing research on the electrical conductivity of perovskite materials, especially focused on doping effects and small polaron behavior. It includes simulation scripts for modeling conductivity and analyzing experimental data.
