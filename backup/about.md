I am currently a PhD student at the [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/) in Troy, New York, USA, holding a graduate research assistantship with [Dr. Victor Robles Sanchez](https://sites.google.com/yale.edu/vrobles/home).

I completed my Masters in 2022 at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, supervised by [Dr. Soumya D Mohanty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C2xWWFsAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis was entitled "Glitch Estimation and Removal Using Adaptive Spline Fitting and Wavelet Shrinkage on the Gravitational Wave Data" and is available from the [ProQuest eTheses Repository](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2801919094?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).

I work on Dark Matter (DM) phenomenology, Galaxy formation and evolution, Gravitational Wave Astronomy, Fundamental Physics, and Big Data. I have specialized in doing the theoretical model and simulation for DM. To find possible signatures of DM, I compare the results with observational data collected using various direct and indirect detection experiments. I am interested in how different models of DM (and, in particular, DM interactions like gravitational interaction of DM) can be distinguished in direct detection experiments and indirect and collider searches. Also, I am interested in how the galaxy forms and evolves with DM. DM can lead us to build a relationship between quantum mechanics and cosmological equations, a long-standing fundamental physics question. This information should prove vital for unifying fundamental forces. I am also interested in the speed of light (c) and want to build a one-way experiment to measure the speed of c. Gravitational wave astronomy is one of the sources for multimessenger astronomy and can be an excellent source for identifying DM and many other aspects of astronomy. Also, the data coming from all these detectors should be analyzed meticulously to detect the signals by removing noises and glitches. Hence, I want to build efficient online methods to analyze the data and find these signals for parameter estimation.
