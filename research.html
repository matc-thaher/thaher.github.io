        <!-- Dark Matter Subsection -->
        <div class="research-section">
            <h3>Dark Matter</h3>
            <img src="path-to-dark-matter-image.jpg" alt="Dark Matter" class="research-img">
            <p>My research focuses on investigating the nature of Dark Matter, a mysterious substance that makes up approximately 85% of the universe’s mass. I explore various theoretical models to understand its properties and potential interactions with known particles.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Galaxy Subsection -->
        <div class="research-section">
            <h3>Galaxy Formation and Evolution</h3>

            <h3>Gravitational Wave Astronomy</h3>
            <img src="path-to-gravitational-waves-image.jpg" alt="Gravitational Wave Astronomy" class="research-img">
            <p>I have worked on signal processing techniques for analyzing data from gravitational wave detectors, focusing on methods for glitch detection and removal using adaptive spline fitting and wavelet shrinkage.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Big Data Subsection -->
        <div class="research-section">
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <img src="path-to-machine-learning-image.jpg" alt="Big Data" class="research-img">
            <p>Incorporating machine learning techniques in physics research has been a significant aspect of my work. I develop and apply algorithms to improve the analysis of large datasets, particularly in astrophysical phenomena.</p>
